* Event processing uses autonomous transactions so they will not interfere with
your application's code.

* Events must be started and stopped within the same session since the AUDSID 
is used in the start and stop code.

* Above must be done to support >1 thread processing the same event.

* This code is not designed for millions of events. It is a tool for moderate
event processing and instrumenting your code base. We are dealing with longer
periods here also. Not microseconds. 

* If you call stop_event without starting the event the code will silently 
fail. If we raised an error it could interfere with the application you 
are instrumenting and that acceptable.

* A regularly scheduled purge is run to remove orphans in audsid_event
table. Orphans are created by calling start without calling stop. The default
value is 4 hours old. There is a setting in arcsql_config to change this.

* If start_event is called again before calling stop no error is returned.
The new start time is recorded. I will be adding some ability to see misses
like this. When you see misses you should look at your instrumentation code
closer and find the code path that is the issue.
