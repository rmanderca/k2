### ArcSQL

A large/rich library for features for doing many things. This library is installed by default when you install K2.

#### ArcSQL views

The ./arcsql_views folder contains a number of views which may be helpful. There are some additional grants required for these views which is why they are not necessarily installed by default. 

To install run ```./arcsql_views_grants.sql``` as an administrator. Then Run ```./arcsql_views_install.sql``` as the schema owner.
